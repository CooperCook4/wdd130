        Hello everyone and welcome to an indepth guide on how you can build your own computer! I love computers and I am sure you do too! We all use computers one way
        or another in our daily lives. Throughout this website, you will learn the basics of how to assemble a brand new computer from parts you have gathered. You will 
        also learn about the basics of what those components do with one another and how each one helps to create computers that everyone uses today.
        There are many parts that go into assembling a computer and they each have their own role in allowing the computer to operate.

      <h3>Parts Required and Descriptions</h3>
      <p>
        There are many key components that help the computer operate. First, there is the CPU, Central Processing Unit. This is like the brain of the computer. It processes actions 
        that the computer must complete. Next, theres the GPU, graphics processing unit. The graphics card is what helps the computer turn all the data into visuals on your screen.
        Then, there's the PSU, power supply. The power supply is what supplies the recommended amount of power to each component within the computer. Next, there is your RAM, random
        access memory. This is a very key component because the RAM makes very quick processes like machine operation, opening programs, or other short time sensitive processes. Then,
        there is your storage device. This can be a hard drive, SSD, or m.2 SSD. These all store data such as operation system files or personal files onto your computer for you to access. 
        Finally, there is your case. The case is the piece that encloses all the components safely inside of it.

      </ul>
      <h3>Assembly Process</h3>
      <p>
        1. The very first thing we are going to want to do is prep our case for the computer. This just means removing the side panels to allow us access inside of the case. There should be
        a box of hardware within the case, screws and other tools, if your case is new. 
        
        2. There will be some motherboard standoffs that will line up with holes on your motherboard. Screw in your motherboard into those standoffs. 
        
        3. Then, grab your powersupply and put it underneath the powersupply shroud at the bottom of the case. It is very important to make sure that 
        the fan on the powersupply is facing downwards and the cables are on the inside of the case. There are some important cables on the powersupply that we will use later which are the 
        vga, cpu, sata, and motherboard cables. 
        
        4. Next, we can install your cpu. It is very important that you take this very slowly since the cpu is a fagile component. Line up the triangle on the 
        cpu to the triangle on the cpu slot on the motherboard. Pull up the retention arm, place the cpu in the socket, and push down on the retention arm. 
        
        5. Next, grab your two RAM sticks and instert them into slots 2 and 4 on the motherboard. They can only go in one way due to the notch on the RAM sticks. They should just click into place. 
        
        6. Next, take your gpu and put it into the first slot on the motherboard for the gpu. This should also click into place. Screw in the screw for the gpu located towards the 
        back side of the case to secure the gpu into place. 
        
        7. Now, it's time to plug in some cables. First, grab the 24 pin motherboard cable, it will be the largest one, and plug it into the 24 pin connector on the side of the 
        motherboard towards the front of the case. 
        
        8. Next, take your cpu cable and install it in the top left of the motherboard in the cpu power slot. 
        
        9. Finally, use the vga cable and plug that into 
        the front of the gpu. 
        
        10. Finally, depending on what storage unit you are using, we shall install the storage. If you are using an m.2 ssd, slot it into the m.2 slot which is typically 
        in the middle of the motherboard. Slot it in, push down, and secure with a small, provided screw. If you are using a normal ssd or hard drive, locate your hard drive cages or ssd slots on the 
        back side of the case and screw in the device. You are going to want to grab a sata data cable from the motherboard box and plug that into the sata data slot on your storage device 
        and your motherboard. Then, you are going to want to grab the sata cable from the powersupply and plug that into the storage device. 
        
        11. The last step is case cable management. This depends
        on your motherboard and case so refer to your motherboard manual to see where the case cables plug into your motherboard. Once everything is in place and plugged in, flip the 
        power switch on your power supply and boom! Your brand new computer is all ready for an installation of a new operating system!
