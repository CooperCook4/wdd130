                <p>1. The very first thing we are going to want to do is prep our case for the computer. This just means removing the side panels to allow us access inside of the case. There should be
                    a box of hardware within the case, screws and other tools, if your case is new.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="step2">
                <p>2. There will be some motherboard standoffs that will line up with holes on your motherboard. Screw in your motherboard into those standoffs.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="step3">
                <p>3. Then, grab your powersupply and put it underneath the powersupply shroud at the bottom of the case. It is very important to make sure that 
                    the fan on the powersupply is facing downwards and the cables are on the inside of the case. There are some important cables on the powersupply that we will use later which are the 
                    vga, cpu, sata, and motherboard cables. </p>
            </section>

            <section class="step4">
                <p>4. Next, we can install your cpu. It is very important that you take this very slowly since the cpu is a fagile component. Line up the triangle on the 
                    cpu to the triangle on the cpu slot on the motherboard. Pull up the retention arm, place the cpu in the socket, and push down on the retention arm.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="step5">
                <p>5. Next, grab your two RAM sticks and instert them into slots 2 and 4 on the motherboard. They can only go in one way due to the notch on the RAM sticks. 
                    They should just click into place.</p>
            </section>
            <img class="step5-img" src="images/step5.jpg" alt="ram installation">

            <section class="step6">
                <p>6. Next, take your gpu and put it into the first slot on the motherboard for the gpu. This should also click into place. Screw in the screw for the gpu located towards the 
                    back side of the case to secure the gpu into place.</p>
            </section>
            <img class="step6-img" src="images/step6.jpg" alt="gpu installation">

            <section class="step7">
                <p>7. Now, it's time to plug in some cables. First, grab the 24 pin motherboard cable, it will be the largest one, and plug it into the 24 pin connector on the side of the 
                    motherboard towards the front of the case. </p>
            </section>
            <img class="step7-img" src="images/step7.jpg" alt="cable installation">

            <section class="step8">
                <p>8. Next, take your cpu cable and install it in the top left of the motherboard in the cpu power slot. </p>
            </section>
            <img class="step8-img" src="images/step8.png" alt="cpu cable installation">

            <section class="step9">
                <p>9. Finally, use the vga cable and plug that into the front of the gpu. </p>
            </section>
            <img class="step9-img" src="images/step9.jpg" alt="gpu cable installation">

            <section class="step10">
                <p>10. Finally, depending on what storage unit you are using, we shall install the storage. If you are using an m.2 ssd, slot it into the m.2 slot which is typically 
                    in the middle of the motherboard. Slot it in, push down, and secure with a small, provided screw. If you are using a normal ssd or hard drive, locate your hard drive cages or ssd slots on the 
                    back side of the case and screw in the device. You are going to want to grab a sata data cable from the motherboard box and plug that into the sata data slot on your storage device 
                    and your motherboard. Then, you are going to want to grab the sata cable from the powersupply and plug that into the storage device. 
                    </p>
            </section>

            <section class="step11"> 
                <p>11. The last step is case cable management. This depends
                on your motherboard and case so refer to your motherboard manual to see where the case cables plug into your motherboard. </p>

            <section class="final">
                <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
                <p>Once everything is in place and plugged in, flip the power switch on your power supply and boom! Your brand new computer is all ready for an installation of 
                    a new operating system!</p></p>
