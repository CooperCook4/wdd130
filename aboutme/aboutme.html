    <h2>Cooper Cook</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Cooper Cook. I am a junior here at BYU-Idaho and I am studying computer science. I am hoping to get into cyber security in the future but I am
        still open to many different options since there's a wide variety of jobs in computer science. I love to go skiing in the winter, I personally think winter is the best
        season but I know many would disagree with me. I also love to to work on and modify my car. I currently drive a Ford Focus ST and it is basically my child. I am a manager at
        a soda shack called Pick Me Up and I have been there for about two and a half years. I love being able to work with others and being able to lead my team!
